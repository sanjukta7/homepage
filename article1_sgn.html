Over the course of millions of years, life has evolved from unicellular organisms to complex multicellular beings like us. While we have a solid understanding of how these evolutionary transitions occurred, the underlying question of why remains less clear. 

Specifically, why did unicellular organisms evolve into colonies and subsequently into multicellular organisms? 
Why did asexual reproduction give way to sexual reproduction? 
What role did the transfer of information play in these transitions, and to what extent was information shared within and across populations in the earliest stages of life? 
Lastly, what drove the emergence of autonomous or sentient beings?

At each stage of development or change, there can be a question of why. I try to add a unified understanding to the why behind all these changes. A unified understanding can come intuitively, but formalising these into a patterned approach can help look at the problem more objectively.
