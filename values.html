                    <li> We have a bright, limitless future. Not certain at the moment (it never is) but it is a possibility. I find that we are not there yet (With all these years of human civilisation behind us, I have been having a hard time accepting this truth as a child)                     </li>
                    <li> I believe living can be down to attributed to being able to ‘have’ the perception of time, and finding ways to make this perception more and more mysterious to stand by watchers. </li>
                    <li> I find learning as a tool to help us experience the beauty around us more profoundly, ultimately to be able to appreciate it fully </li>
                    <li> We have an enormous gift, I believe that one should also assume responsibility for this gift; which is immense </li>
                    <li> I put belief in myself but always leave room for scrutiny. </li>
                    <li> I grew up moving around a lot (To the point that I have changed schools every year), got used to the role of observing and knowing people from a distance, perhaps outside of rules. Trying to unlearn the rules as I’ve come to know them now</li>
